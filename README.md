## Presidents

Created by: Nicholas Marchese and Chaz Sroczynski

Week 7 group project at Skill Distillery, and the first full web application project in the program. 
The app displays all US presidents, their portrait, term years, political party affiliation and an interesting factoid about them.

To use the app a user can click previous and next buttons to load the previous or next president's information.
The app gracefully handles the first and last presidents by disabling the previous or next button if the first or last president is
desplayed. Additionally, users can select a specific president by entering a term number in the "Jump to Term" field
and clicking "GO."

Technologies used include: Java, HTML5, CSS3, Tomcat 8, JPA, and AWS.
